	<p>Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation.<br>
	The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne.<br>
	Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams that consist of five players, with both teams occupying their own separate base on the map.<br>
	Each of the ten players independently control a powerful character, known as a "hero", that each feature unique abilities and different styles of play.<br>
	During a match, a player and their team collects experience points and items for their heroes in order to fight through the opposing team's defenses.<br>
	A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient".<br>
	Dota 2 has a widespread and active competitive scene, with teams from across the world playing professionally in various dedicated leagues and tournaments.<br>
	Premium Dota 2 tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of US dollars, the highest of any eSport. <br>
	The largest of them is known as The International, which is produced by Valve and held annually at the KeyArena in Seattle.<br>
	Valve also sponsors smaller, but more frequently held tournaments known as the Majors, which lead up to the International every year. <br>
	For larger tournaments, media coverage is done by a selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events.<br>

	  <p>The Kiev Major kicks off competition in less than two weeks, with Swiss-style Group Stage play on April 24 – 25, and the single-elimination Main Event taking place April 27 – 30 at the National Palace of Arts in Kiev, Ukraine.<br>
		Head to the Compendium section of your Battle Pass to open your Player Cards and fill out your Fantasy Lineups, make your Tournament Predictions, and see the full roster of broadcast talent.<br>
		Once the Group Stage concludes, you’ll also have the chance to fill out a Bracket Prediction for the Main Event. You’ll need to decide: Will old favorites reign supreme, or can another group of upstarts wreak havoc on the main stage?<br>
		The more accurate your predictions, the more Battle Points that await you.<br>
		We look forward to welcoming the teams, talent, and fans to Kiev for another showdown to determine who stands atop the best sixteen teams in the world.<br>

	   <p>The International (TI) is an annual Dota 2 eSports tournament hosted by Valve Corporation, the game's developer.<br>
	   The first tournament took place in Cologne, Germany at Gamescom in 2011 and was held shortly after the public reveal of Dota 2, with a total prize pot of $1.6 million.<br>
	   The second International took place in 2012 at the Benaroya Hall in Seattle, and retained the same $1.6 million prize structure.<br>
	   For the third International in 2013, again at Benaroya Hall, Valve introduced an interactive, digital "compendium" which fans could purchase to follow the event and contribute to the prize pool; which reached a $2.8 million prize pool with $1.2 million added from compendium purchases.<br>
