	<p>Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation.<br>
	The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne.<br>
	Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams that consist of five players, with both teams occupying their own separate base on the map.<br>
	Each of the ten players independently control a powerful character, known as a "hero", that each feature unique abilities and different styles of play.<br>
	During a match, a player and their team collects experience points and items for their heroes in order to fight through the opposing team's defenses.<br>
	A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient".<br>
	Dota 2 has a widespread and active competitive scene, with teams from across the world playing professionally in various dedicated leagues and tournaments.<br>
	Premium Dota 2 tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of US dollars, the highest of any eSport. <br>
	The largest of them is known as The International, which is produced by Valve and held annually at the KeyArena in Seattle.<br>
	Valve also sponsors smaller, but more frequently held tournaments known as the Majors, which lead up to the International every year. <br>
	For larger tournaments, media coverage is done by a selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events.<br>

	   <p>The International (TI) is an annual Dota 2 eSports tournament hosted by Valve Corporation, the game's developer.<br>
	   The first tournament took place in Cologne, Germany at Gamescom in 2011 and was held shortly after the public reveal of Dota 2, with a total prize pot of $1.6 million.<br>
	   The second International took place in 2012 at the Benaroya Hall in Seattle, and retained the same $1.6 million prize structure.<br>
	   For the third International in 2013, again at Benaroya Hall, Valve introduced an interactive, digital "compendium" which fans could purchase to follow the event and contribute to the prize pool; which reached a $2.8 million prize pool with $1.2 million added from compendium purchases.<br>
